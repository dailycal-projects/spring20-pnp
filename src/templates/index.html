        <p align="justify"><span class='dropcap'>I</span>n March 2020, UC Berkeley implemented a universal pass/no pass grading system, setting a campus precedent for an adjusted grading system during remote schooling. Adjustments were extended through Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, with various differences between colleges. </p>

        <p align="justify"> The bar graph shows the number of letter grades requested by students before and during 
          the pandemic. In Spring 2020, during universal pass/no pass, requested grades were half of their usual amount. Fall 2020 was closer to prior semesters, but still fell short overall. College of Natural Resources was the only college that surpassed all prior numbers.

          In Spring 2020, 61% of grades across all undergraduate schools were P/NP. Haas had the highest at 66%, with College of Engineering following closely at 64%. The lowest percentage is held by the College of Chemistry at 50%. The Daily Californian previously found that chemistry students are the most likely to attend graduate school immediately after undergrad. Haas and engineering students are the most likely to be employed.

          By Fall 2020, only 31% of grades were P/NP. College of Environmental Design had the lowest percentage of P/NP grades at 21%. Similarly, only 25% of chemistry grades were P/NP. By contrast, 39% of engineering grades were P/NP, a 7% difference from the next lowest percentage held by Haas. Interestingly, Haas students had stricter grading policies for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, only allowing one business course per semester to be taken P/NP. In their policy announcement, Haas stated they “must also consider the academic implications and potential negative impact on students for career and graduate school opportunities.”
